**Welcome!**

Hey there! I'm Gabriel Rabanal Bola√±os, a particle physicist with a deep interest in machine learning and data science. I recently completed my Ph.D. in Physics at [Harvard University](https://lppc.physics.harvard.edu/), where I did research on multiboson interactions at CERN using machine learning. Additionally, I contributed to the upgrade of the muon spectrometer of the ATLAS Experiment at CERN by working on detector commissioning and developing software for detector geometry.

My academic journey began with a B.Sc. in Physics from the [National University of Engineering](https://fc.uni.edu.pe/en/nosotros/) in Lima, Peru, where I was born and raised. During my undergraduate studies, I gained experience in nuclear physics at the [nuclear reactor in Peru](https://www.ipen.gob.pe/images/racso.jpg). Afterwards, I traveled to the United States to complete an internship at [Yale University](https://wlab.yale.edu/), where I worked on neutrino physics.

I'm also passionate about languages and linguistics. I have expertise in phonetics, grammar, and writing systems across various language families. I'm fluent in Spanish, English, and French, and I have advanced knowledge of ancient languages, mainly Akkadian and Sumerian, but I like reading anything cuneiform. Furthermore, I'm particularly interested in the indigenous languages of the Americas, such as Quechua. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new languages and reading into historical linguistics. I am also working on several personal projects that blend my interests in data science and languages.
