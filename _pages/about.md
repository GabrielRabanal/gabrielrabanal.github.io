**Welcome!**

Hey there! I'm a particle physicist with a deep interest in machine learning and data science. I recently completed my Ph.D. in Physics at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu), where I did research on multiboson interactions at CERN using machine learning. Additionally, I contributed to the upgrade of the muon spectrometer of the ATLAS Experiment at CERN by working on detector commissioning and developing software for detector geometry.

My academic journey began with a B.Sc. in Physics from the [National University of Engineering](https://fc.uni.edu.pe/en/nosotros/) in Lima, Peru, where I was born and raised. During my undergraduate studies, I gained experience in nuclear physics at the Peruvian Institute of Nuclear Energy, and I also completed an internship at Yale University, where I worked on neutrino physics.

Apart from my scientific interests, I'm very passionate about languages and linguistics, and I have expertise in phonetics, grammar, and writing systems across various language families. I'm fluent in Spanish, English, and French, and I also have advanced knowledge of ancient languages, mainly Akkadian and Sumerian. I am also interested in indigenous languages of the Americas such as Quechua.
