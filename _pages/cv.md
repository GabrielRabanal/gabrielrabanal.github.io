You can download a PDF copy of my academic CV [here](/files/pdf/Academic_CV.pdf), and my one-page resume [here](/files/pdf/Resume.pdf).

Please note that I have two last names according to [Spanish naming customs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_naming_customs). However, in the United States, I am legally required to use both last names as a single compound last name. I have no middle name.
