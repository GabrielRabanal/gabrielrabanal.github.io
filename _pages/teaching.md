I have worked as a teaching assistant at both Harvard University and the National University of Engineering, where I taught undergraduate courses in various areas of physics. My responsibilities included leading theory and lab sections, offering individualized support during office hours, and creating course materials. By actively teaching, I have helped students in improving their analytical skills and mastering data analysis tools. In addition to teaching, I have experience incorporating coding and data analysis into the curriculum, which prepares students for advanced studies and research in science and engineering.
